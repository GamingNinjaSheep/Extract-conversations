# Extract-conversations
A program that extracts conversations from GT-MP log files and places them into a text file.

1. Place the GT-MP logfile in the same folder as "Extract conversations v1.2.exe".
2. Rename the logfile to "original.log".
3. Run "Extract conversations v1.2.exe".
4. The extracted content is placed into a new file called "conversation.txt".
